    //OOP:

    // Encapsulation - hiding data, private keyword for fields and public getters and setters to access and control these fields.

    // Inheritance - IS A relationship, give common features in parent class and reuse them easily in child classes with extend keyword.

    // Abstraction - focusing on essentials, and not worrying on details.
                     //Abstract methods without body in Abstract class, and override these methods in child classes.
                     //Interface helps if some childs have shared features and others don't have, so its not efficient to create them in parent class, but efficient in Interface


    // Polymorphism - ability of objects to have many forms.
                     //Reference type is Parent class and Object type is Child class.




    //abstract or parent class - needed if all child classes have common features.
    //child class - if there is something unique only for one class.
    //interface - when several classes have common feature but some not.
