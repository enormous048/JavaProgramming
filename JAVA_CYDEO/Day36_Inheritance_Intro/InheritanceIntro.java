    //Subclasses can have its own fields and methods besides Superclass fields and methods.


    //It improves reusability - created one parent class and don't need to declare variables again in child classes.
    //Less code, if you need to add something, you just go to parent class only.

    // All fields methods will be inherited, as long as they are protected or public.
