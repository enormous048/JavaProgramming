    //OOP - is a design pattern for applications, made in modular way: easy to maintain, reusability, avoiding duplication.
    //There are 4 OOP concepts:

    //Encapsulation - hiding valuable data, by making objects private, and methods to access public.
    //Inheritance - creating "is a" relationships, to avoid duplication.
    //Abstraction
    //Polymorphism




    //Encapsulation - hiding valuable data, by making objects private.(Hiding instance variables)
    //Getters and Setters are also instance method because static don't accept instance variables.

    //Methods to get and set must be placed in the same class as private object, and these methods must be public.
