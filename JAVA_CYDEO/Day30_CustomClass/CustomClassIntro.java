    //Class is a template for objects. Class determines what the behaviour of object will be.

    //Class can contain attributes(fields).
    //      can contain methods(actions).

    //You can create multiple objects of the same class and you don't need to create fields or methods for each of them.




    // Instance variable - are variable declared outside methods or blocks.
    // They are belonged to objects and each object has its own memory.
    // Each object has a separate copy of instance variables so you can pass different value to them.


    // Instance methods - each object has its own copy of instance method.
    // We dont give static specifier, the reason is to access method with object but not with class name.
    // and static allows only one copy.
