    //You only show for user  what is done  area(); calculate(); But he does not see how it is done.



    //Abstract method - is method without body, and it is meant to be overriden.
    //Abstract method can't be static, final, private -- can only be created in abstract class and interface.
    //(Раніше перед оверрайдом ми мали ретурн 0 робити в перент класі щоб працювало)

    //Abstract class - can't create objects from abstract class.
    //Abstract class is meant to be a parent.



    //Abstraction can only happen if there is abstract class or interface.
